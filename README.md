#Mission Statement
This started as a personal project purely for fun and quickly turned into a viable product. I decided to open source it because I believe that community supported software produces a better product. Feel free to hack away on it and put up PRs. I am very busy professionally, but try to spend all of my free time on this project. I welcome any and all help available. Enjoy!
